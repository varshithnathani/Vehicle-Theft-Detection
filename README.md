In this project, we address a major contemporary issue: car theft. We aim to minimize the risk of theft by using facial recognition implemented on a Raspberry Pi. 
The project utilizes an AI approach to run the code, storing multiple photos in a folder. This system is capable of identifying individuals based on the images present.
